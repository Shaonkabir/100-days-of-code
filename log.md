# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Feb 13, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed few _JavaScript Algorithms_ of freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: Few days ago, I've completed JavaScript Algroithms from freecodecamp. Now I'm going to practice more to level my craft up. If I practice 1 Algorithms everyday, after 100 Days later, It'll be 100 Algorithms which is almost a lot. That's my current target.

### Day 2: Feb 14, Friday

**Today's Progess**: I've started learning _CSS Flexbox_ and Completed an _Algorithms_

**Thoughts**: I just watched a tutorial of @bradtraversy on Flexbox. It's awesome. I need to master on it. After that I'll learn CSS Grid and create my own CSS Framework combining Flex+Grid._I just need to create a CSS Framework to learn CSS deeply and avoid using Framework (like: Bootstrap) in a small project!_

### Day 3: Feb 18, Thuesday

**Today's Progess**: Solved a fontend task by entprtaher/Taher vai

**Thoughts**: I can't code for 3 days because my laptop damaged while working. I've fixed all issues already.

### Day 4: Feb 19, Wednesday

**Today's Progess**: Solve _Fibonacci Number Algorithms_ and learn about Strees Testing

**Thoughts**: I've solved a Popular JavaScript Algorithms named "Fibonacci Number" as a part of #100DaysOfAlgorithm and Learned about Headless Chrome and Browser Testing (Strees Testing).
I'm going to complete a JavaScript Testing Course by @kentcdodds. He is awesome teacher. There's no alternatives of Testing.\
I've forked a repo for practicing JavaScript Algorithms. [Here it is!](https://github.com/shaonkabir8/awesome-algorithms)

### Day 4: Feb 20, Thursday

**Today's Progess**: Solve an _Algorithms_ named "Find Vowel"

**Thoughts**: I've solved a Popular JavaScript Algorithms named "Find Vowel". Basically It'll count the vowel number from a String and print it out on console.\
I just created a well commented gist to remove White Space from a String or Array. [Here](https://gist.github.com/shaonkabir8/9cdbf5116e0f45b6578d1287e11cbb28) it is.\
Finally I'm available as @shaonkabir8 on internet. Hurray!!

### Day 4: Feb 21, Friday

**Today's Progess**: start to create a super sexy projects to Find Movie [Movie Finder]

**Thoughts**: Finally, I've started building Movie Finder application using MovieDB API. It would be the best work of my React Dev Career.I'll implement many features on it.\
I've practice _Algorithms_ which i've done yet.\
It's for today. Actually I can't practice more due to 21 Feb (Internation Mother Language Day)

Today I've re-build it with React (use SCSS instead of regular CSS) and added extra functionalities.\
Unfortunately can't practice _Algorithms_ today..

### Day 4: Feb 23, Sunday

**Today's Progess**: deploy Drum Kit Application and make a Header on Movie Finder App

**Thoughts**: Finished building Drum Machine Application and Deployed on Netlify.Though some todo's aren't completed yet. I'll do those tasks later.\
Finally modified CRA Boilerplate into my folder structure. Everytime i've to do exact same task. To avoid these boring task, I've created React Boilerplate.\
Started Building Movie Finder Application.\ I'll build it along with practicing Freecodecamp
